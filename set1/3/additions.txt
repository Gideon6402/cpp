1) The C++ compiler is way stricter with the type const addition. The C compiller just a warning when a const is changed but the C++ compiler stops working.
2) One can add namespaces, this makes it possible to have clearer code and prevents a user from using a variable name twice for different variables.
3) In C++ we know use the <iostream> and its object cin and cout. This is a great improvement over printf and scanf because the input and the output can now be manipulated in many more ways.
4) In C++ one can use references. This facilitates an easier way to handle with memory adresses.
5) In C++ one can use function overloading. With this one can know decide what to do with a function based on what the input type is.
6) In C++ one can use operator overloading, this is for example very convenient for using << both for a bitwise operation and to add a string to a stream
