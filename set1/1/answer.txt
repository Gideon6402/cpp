Descriptions:
An object file is a file that is an intermidiate state. 
The compiler has compiled the listing into computer readable
file but references to other files (such as headers and extern
variables) are not yet linked. This file cannot be executed yet.

An excutable is linked. Possibly multiple files and their headers
are combined to make one excutable file.
