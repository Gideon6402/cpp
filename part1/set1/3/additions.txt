1) Upgrade of objects: functions can be added, information can be set to 
private.
2) References are added which is a completely new way of dealing with 
adresses.
3) Namespaces are added, this helps keeping variables, functions and 
classes local. In addition to that, it is now possible to add an 
initializer to a conditional statement.
4) The streams std:cin and std:cout from the header <iostream> are added. 
This gives the programmer a way more powerfull tool the handle input and 
output.
5) Many new types are added. For example: wchar_t, size_t, bool. On top of 
that also std::string is added which gives a more powerful object to deal 
with strings.
6) Funtionalities are added: for loops can know also iterate over lists, 
functions can be overloaded which means that a function can do different 
things dependent on the input type.
