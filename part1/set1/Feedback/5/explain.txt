Redirection using `<` and `>` can be used to read a file as input to a command or write the output of a command to a file, respectively.

In particular, the line:

program < in > out

uses the contents of file `in` as input for the command `program` and writes the result to the file `out`.

Piping uses the output of one command as the input for another.

For example, the line:

program | less

Uses the output of the command `program` and uses it as an argument to the command `less`, which shows the text in a scrollable way.
