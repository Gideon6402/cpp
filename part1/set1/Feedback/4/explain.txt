Since the string contains the sequence )" and this is also the marker
for the end of the string, the compiler will think it has read
the string in its entirety when it has not yet done so.
We can fix this by adding a (normally optional) label/delimeter
which is not contained in the RSL.
The rule is that we will not be able to use )" (or any other delimeter)
at the end of a string when this sequence is part of the string itself.
