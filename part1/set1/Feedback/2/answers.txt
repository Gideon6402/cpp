Answers:
The difference between a declaration and definition is that a definition introduces a new object and 
allocates memory for it, while a declaration does not allocate memory, it merely announces a variable exists. (A declaration just announces the function's name and type)

Header files are used for defining external functions, they declare functions that can be used by multiple programs, like iostream declares cout.
JB: std::cout is an object, not a function.

The compiler uses header files while in the preprocessor fase because the header files declare some functions, like cout.
JB: Non-sequitur. Or at least I don't see the logic.
The compiler uses libraries while in the linking fase, because here the compiler searches for what the code of the declared functions are in the libraries.
JB: What is 'code' here? And please fix grammar.

A library is not object module, it is a collection of object modules.

The object is not executable beacause it does not contain all the code it referneces to. 
The linker must first link the objects together to create executable code.
