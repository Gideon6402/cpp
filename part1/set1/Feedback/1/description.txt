An object file is an intermediate file that is generated by the compiler.  
It contains machine code but it is not yet executable since the external object files have not yet been linked.

The executable file is the object file after it has been linked to the header files and other object files.
It can be executed on a computer, because all the header files and other object files have already been linked.

JB: So an executable has been linked. What has the linker done so that in
JB: contrast to an object file, it *can* be executed? Also, what's the
JB: difference bewteen linking to header files and linking to object files?
