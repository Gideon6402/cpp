1. The name of an array points to the first element of the array. An array is collection of consecutive pointers to values.

The name of an array is a pointer variable but a pointer doesn't necessarily point to the first element of an array. A pointer variable can point to any variable even if this variable is not the first element in a list.

A pointer variable is the address of the variable it points to. It can be derefenced to alter or view its contents.

2. A reference is a alias to the variable it references. Once a reference is made, any alteration or viewing of this reference will actually alter/view the variable it references to.

 
What do we mean by the word array? Literally the name list in list[] or more the concept of something that contains elements? Assume: we mean the name.
